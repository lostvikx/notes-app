# JS Notes App

I didn't really make this all by myself, followed along a tutorial.

## OOP
This project uses object-oriented programming paradigm. Although I am someone who thinks functional is the **SO GOOD**, that doesn't mean OOP doesn't have its pros.

## Local Storage
I learnt how to use local storage in the browser and how JSON is used.

I don't own this project.
